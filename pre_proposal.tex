\documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}
% Some/most Computer Society conferences require the compsoc mode option,
% but others may want the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
In recent years, deep learning models have achieved and continued to improve on state-of-the-art results on pretty much all NLP tasks.
However, adversarial examples -- small perturbations to a model's inputs that cause its outputs to be wrong -- have revealed weaknesses in many models' robustness and generalization abilities.
Furthermore, the end-to-end, black-box nature of these models greatly limits the interpretability of their decisions, making it even more difficult to modify them to defend against (known and unknown) adversarial attacks.

One could say that the fundamental shortcoming of all current NLP systems is a lack of a deep, `real' understanding of language.
Therefore, we will focus on the task of natural language inference (NLI), a very direct test of natural language understanding.
The setup of the NLI task is to determine whether a \emph{hypothesis} is true given a \emph{premise}, answering \emph{entailment}, \emph{contradiction}, or \emph{neutral} (the hypothesis's truth value can't be determined).

% Most neural systems designed for these tasks create or use some form of vector sentence representations/embeddings, often computed as a function of single word embeddings. \\
The current top-performing systems for NLI are built on pretrained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) \cite{devlin_bert:_2018} representations of sentences, fine-tuned to specific tasks.
The architecture of BERT is built on the Transformer architecture \cite{vaswani_attention_2017}, which is a non-recurrent, purely attention-based neural model architecture.
While many analyses of recurrent models (RNNs, LSTMs of various kinds) exist, there is relatively little work on Transformer-based architectures.

Our goal is to pit BERT and other high-performing models with varying architectures against different adversarial attacks, and carefully examine when and why they fail.
Those insights will help us interpret what the model is really learning and understanding, and hopefully lead to ideas for defending against those attacks and generally improving the performance of the model.
It is also possible that the failures of these models come not from their architecture, but from significant gaps in their training data; we will try to disentangle that blame.

% There are two modes of failure on adversarial examples: oversensitivity and overstability.
% Oversensitivity is when inputs are perturbed in a way that should \emph{not} affect the output, but the model changes its output (also called Should-Not-Change).
% Overstability is when input perturbations \emph{should} affect the output, but the model does not change (also called Should-Change).
% Our hypothesis is that both kinds of failure come from the model not paying attention to the actually relevant parts of the input.

% Therefore, one idea for a defense technique is to explicitly judge the relevance of input sentences.


% The study of adversarial examples began in the field of computer vision, where inputs are continuous, leading to various mathematical methods for generating adversarial examples.
% However, because the input space of natural language is discrete, and even minor perturbations can completely change semantics or make sentences ungrammatical, the variety of adversarial attacks has been limited.

\section{Related Work}
Various ways of generating adversarial examples (also called challenge datasets) have been shown to break state-of-the-art models:
\begin{itemize}
  \item McCoy et al. (2019) \cite{mccoy_right_2019} show that BERT and other models use specific fallible, surface-level syntactic heuristics, by testing them on a challenge dataset (HANS) that violates those heuristics.
  Their heuristics can be categorised into lexical overlap, subsequence, and constituent.
  % They then try training the models on data very similar to their new dataset, and find that the models do stop using specific types of heuristics if they are trained on examples that violate them.
  % However, when failures of only some of the heuristics were exposed, the models were only sometimes able to generalise what they learned from other heuristics.
  \item Glockner et al. (2018) \cite{glockner_breaking_2018} created a challenge dataset focused on simple lexical inferences and world knowledge by replacing words in the SNLI dataset with related words.
  \item Naik et al. (2018) \cite{naik_stress_2018} created examples based on antonyms, numerical reasoning, word overlap (append ``and true is true'' to hypothesis) negation words (append ``false is not true''), length mismatch (append ``and true is true'' 5 times), and spelling errors.
\end{itemize}

Liu et al. (2019) \cite{liu_inoculation_2019} describe a method of analysing challenge datasets, to figure out whether the model or the original training dataset is the primary cause of weakness of the trained model.
Using a metaphor of inoculation, they expose the model to just a few challenge examples, and then re-test it on the original test set and the challenge test set.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item If the model still fails the challenge dataset, the weakness probably lies in its design/architecture.
  \item If the model can now succeed at the challenge dataset (without sacrificing performance on the original dataset), then the original dataset is at fault.
  \item If the model does better on the challenge dataset but worse on the original dataset, the model is learning something not generalizable from the extra challenge data.
  This suggests that the challenge dataset is somehow not representative of the phenomenon it was trying to test, for example being very skewed to a particular label.
\end{enumerate}

One persistent challenge if existing datasets are at fault is that it is impossible to augment the training set with every possible kind of challenge example, meaning that we can only ever effectively defend against known attacks.


\section{Proposed Work}
The first step will be to reproduce the models' results on MNLI (the dominant NLI dataset).
% \cite{williams_broad-coverage_2018}.

Then, we will take two approaches to understanding the models' failures on adversarial examples:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item By testing the models on different kinds of adversarial examples, we can see which models are better and worse at encoding various kinds of information, for example being better at learning syntactic or semantic knowledge.
  \item We will examine the models' decision-making process with an existing visualization tool such as \cite{vig_visualizing_2019}, which displays the weights learned and activated in different parts of the model by a particular input.
\end{enumerate}

If we gain useful insights about the models from those analyses, we can maybe incorporate them into modifying model design, or adding (e.g. preprocessing) steps to the system pipeline.




\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we aim to chip away at the problem of model interpretability in modern neural models, by examining successful models' failures on adversarial examples in the task of NLI.
Interpretability leads to more useful (and safe) models for practical use, as well as helping to generate ideas for future higher-performing models.
